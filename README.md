# Variational Autoencoder with TensorFlow 2

Works using a python (3.7 or 3.8) environment with the following packages: 

tensorflow==2.2.0 matplotlib scipy==1.4.1 graphviz pydot pandas jupyterlab imageio .

First train (possibly for more than 100 epochs) and then run the analysis. May not work on recent TensorFlow versions (like 2.3).
